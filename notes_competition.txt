Overall objective:
Provide the fastest algorithm you can design that indicates whether a point is within a city's borders on a 2-dimensional grid (X and Y axes)

Inputs:
Two CSV files:
- cities.csv: contains 5 columns: city name, top-left coordinate X, top-left coordinate Y, bottom-right coordinate X, bottom-right coordinate Y
- points.csv: contains 3 columns: point ID, coordinate X, coordinate Y

Please see example files within Github repository

Coordinates provided assume a 2-D map, with points in (X,Y) notation with X being the horizontal axis and Y the vertical axis. Please see explanation.jpg for visualization


Outputs expected:
- output_points.csv: contains a 4th colum with:
   - if the point is part of or touches a city: the city name
   - if the point is not part of a city: "None"


Assumptions you can make:
- Cities are rectangular and without rotation. I.e. they are completely identifiable via top-left coordinate and bottom-right coordinate
- If a point touches a city (even a corner), then it is considered part of the city. For example point (2,2) is part of city (2,2)-(4,3)
- All coordinates are positive integers: no negative numbers nor decimals
- There can be an unlimited number of cities provided as input
